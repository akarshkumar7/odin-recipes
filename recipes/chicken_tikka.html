    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>Chicken Tikka Kebabs in a richly spiced yogurt marinade. Grilled, barbecued or griddled to perfection, they make an easy, family-pleasing dinner!
        Serve them simply with rice or chapati, or go all out with a big Indian buffet - I've got lots of ideas below!</p1>
    <p2>These skewers are a great option when you know you're going to be in a rush come dinner time. You can make up the kebabs ahead of time and keep them in the fridge till later. Then grill them about 10-15 minutes before you're ready to eat.</p2>
